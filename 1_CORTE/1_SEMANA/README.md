# Complex Number Operations

This Python script, created by Juan Felipe Martinez on January 29, 2024, provides functions to perform various operations on complex numbers.

## Functions

1. `complex_add(a,b)`: Adds two complex numbers.
2. `complex_subs(a,b)`: Subtracts the second complex number from the first.
3. `complex_mult(a,b)`: Multiplies two complex numbers.
4. `complex_div(a,b)`: Divides the first complex number by the second.
5. `complex_modul(a)`: Calculates the modulus of a complex number.
6. `complex_conj(a)`: Finds the conjugate of a complex number.
7. `complex_fase(a)`: Calculates the phase (or argument) of a complex number.
8. `complex_cartesianoPolar(a)`: Converts a complex number from Cartesian to polar coordinates.
9. `complex_polarCartesiano(a)`: Converts a complex number from polar to Cartesian coordinates.

## Usage

The `main()` function prompts the user to input two complex numbers (in the form of a comma-separated pair of real and imaginary parts), and then performs all the above operations on these numbers.

To run the script, use the following command:

```bash
python3 <script_name>.py
